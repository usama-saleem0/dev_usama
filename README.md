Usama 
Hi there. I’m a full-stack developer with experience in all kinds of projects. I’ve worked with modern stacks like MERN, MEAN, and MEVN, and I’m comfortable with CMS platforms such as WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, and Framer.
I build responsive front-end apps with React, Vue, and Angular, while also handling back-end tech with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I’m all about API integration and love working with cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. I also dive into AI developments and make cutting-edge, cross-platform mobile apps with React Native and Flutter.
I'm a Full Stack Developer with over seven years of hands-on experience crafting web and mobile apps. I work with modern stacks like MERN, MEAN, and MEVN, and I can handle everything from the front-end to the back-end with ease.
What I Do:
Front-End:
I build dynamic user interfaces using React.js/ts, Next.js/ts, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Angular, and more. I also work with UI libraries like MUI, Chakra UI, and Ant Design, plus tools like SCSS, Styled Components, and Storybook.
Back-End:
I’m well-versed in Node.js/ts, Nest.js/ts, and Express. Whether it's working with databases like MongoDB, SQL, and Postgres or designing APIs with GraphQL and REST, I’ve got it covered. I’m also experienced in Postman for testing and Firebase for serverless solutions.
Mobile & Cross-Platform:
I develop mobile apps using React Native (CLI/Expo), Flutter, Kotlin, and Swift. I’m passionate about creating seamless experiences that work across different platforms.
CMS & Web Builders:
Need a website? I can work with CMS platforms like WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, and even Framer to create visually stunning, easy-to-manage sites.
DevOps & Cloud:
From setting up CI/CD pipelines to deploying apps on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku, Netlify, or even VPS setups on Linux – I can help your project run smoothly in production.
Extra Stuff:
I also dive into AI developments, cross-platform API integrations, microservices, and much more to bring cutting-edge solutions to life.
I love turning complex challenges into clean, efficient code that makes users happy. Whether it's a full-stack web application, a mobile app, or a headless CMS setup, I'm here to build it with you
